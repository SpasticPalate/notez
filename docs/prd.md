# Notez - Product Requirements Document

**Author:** SpasticPalate
**Date:** 2025-12-21
**Version:** 1.0
**Feature:** Feedback System (Bug Reports & Feature Requests)

---

## Executive Summary

Notez transforms from a personal note-taking application into a collaborative product with built-in user feedback capabilities. This feature enables any logged-in user to submit bug reports or feature requests through a friendly, non-intimidating interface. Administrators receive real-time notifications (in-app + optional Discord/Slack webhooks), can review and manage submissions in a dedicated admin panel, and leverage AI assistance to polish approved items into professional GitHub issues with automatic project board placement.

### What Makes This Special

**"Give your users a voice in the product roadmap - from idea to GitHub issue in seconds."**

The magic is the seamless, zero-friction pipeline:

1. **Friendly Form** → Non-technical users feel comfortable submitting ideas or reporting issues
2. **Instant Alerts** → Admin knows immediately via in-app bell or Discord/Slack ping
3. **AI Polish** → Rough ideas become well-structured GitHub issues automatically
4. **One-Click Publish** → Issue created AND placed on project board in a single action

This bridges the gap between "my wife has an idea" and "tracked issue in my backlog" with minimal overhead.

## Project Classification

**Technical Type:** Web Application (extending existing Notez SPA + REST API)
**Domain:** General (no regulatory requirements)
**Complexity:** Low-Medium (CRUD operations + external integrations)

This is a brownfield feature addition to the existing Notez application:

- Leverages existing authentication, user management, and admin panel infrastructure
- Adds new database models, API endpoints, and frontend components
- Integrates with external services (GitHub API, Discord/Slack webhooks)
- Uses existing AI infrastructure for content enhancement

---

## Success Criteria

**Primary Success Metric:**
Users actively submit feedback and admin can efficiently process it to GitHub.

**Specific Criteria:**

1. **Adoption** - Wife (primary user) submits at least one request/report within first week
2. **Friction** - Submission takes under 60 seconds from clicking "Suggest" to confirmation
3. **Processing** - Admin can go from new request to published GitHub issue in under 2 minutes
4. **Notification Reliability** - Admin is notified within 30 seconds of submission (in-app or webhook)
5. **Quality** - AI-enhanced GitHub issues require minimal manual editing before publish

**Anti-Success (What We're Avoiding):**

- Submissions that sit unreviewed for weeks
- GitHub issues that require significant rewriting
- Users confused about whether to report a bug or request a feature

---

## Product Scope

### MVP - Minimum Viable Product

The essential features that deliver core value:

1. **Unified Feedback Form** - Single form supporting both bug reports and feature requests via type toggle
2. **Admin Dashboard** - List view with filtering by type/status, detail view, status management
3. **In-App Notifications** - Bell icon with unread badge, notification dropdown with direct links
4. **Webhook Alerts** - Single URL configuration supporting Discord and Slack formats
5. **GitHub Integration** - Create issues in configured repo with automatic project board placement
6. **AI Enhancement** - Polish user submissions into professional GitHub issues with preview/edit
7. **User Requested Badge** - Visual token on shipped features/fixes that originated from user feedback, showing users their voice matters

### Growth Features (Post-MVP)

Features that enhance the experience once core is proven:

1. **Email Notifications** - Alternative alert channel for multi-user deployments
2. **User Submission History** - "My Feedback" page showing user's own submissions and their status
3. **Upvoting System** - Allow users to vote on others' feature requests
4. **Public Roadmap View** - Display approved features in a public-facing pipeline view

### Vision (Future)

Long-term possibilities:

1. **Multi-Platform Integration** - GitLab Issues, Jira, Linear support
2. **In-App Changelog** - "What's New" feed populated from shipped GitHub issues (badge system from MVP extends here)
3. **User Segments** - Different submission flows for different user types/roles
4. **Feedback Analytics** - Dashboard showing submission trends, categories, resolution rates

## User Experience Principles

### Design Philosophy

**"One Form, Two Paths"** - Users shouldn't stress about categorization. The form adapts based on a simple, friendly toggle.

**Visual Personality:** Warm, encouraging, non-intimidating. This is a conversation, not a support ticket.

**Key Emotion:** *"They actually WANT my feedback!"*

### Key Interactions

#### Interaction 1: The Submit Moment

- User clicks feedback button in header/menu
- Friendly overlay appears with encouraging copy
- Toggle between "🐛 Report a Problem" and "💡 Suggest Something"
- Form adapts language: bugs get "What happened?" vs features get "What would help?"
- Submit → instant "We got it!" confirmation
- **Target:** Under 60 seconds, feels like texting a friend

#### Interaction 2: Admin's Morning Check

- Open Notez → red badge on notification bell catches eye
- Click bell → dropdown: "Sarah reported a bug: Editor crashes on paste"
- One click → full detail view with action buttons
- **Target:** 3 clicks from login to reviewing a submission

#### Interaction 3: The GitHub Magic Moment

- Admin clicks "Create GitHub Issue" on approved submission
- AI-enhanced preview appears in ~2 seconds
- Review, tweak if needed, click "Publish"
- Issue created + board placement + status updated + link stored
- **Target:** Under 30 seconds from decision to published issue
