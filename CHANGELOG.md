### Changed

- **Public Readiness**: Scrubbed PII, internal hostnames, and hardcoded credentials from compose files, documentation, and test scripts
- **Security Defaults**: Removed all hardcoded secret fallbacks — `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET`, `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`, and `COOKIE_SECRET` now throw on missing values instead of falling back to insecure defaults
- **Governance Files**: Added root `LICENSE` (MIT), `SECURITY.md`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md`

### Removed

- Deleted stale files: `WORK_COMPLETE.md`, `.woodpecker.yml`, `test-auth-api.ps1`, `test-qodo-fixes.ps1`

## [1.7.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- **Token Management UI**: New "API Tokens" section in Settings — create, view, copy, and revoke API tokens from the browser instead of using curl commands
- **Token Reveal Flow**: Raw token shown once after creation with copy-to-clipboard and warning that it won't be displayed again
- **Setup Guide Panel**: Collapsible guide in the tokens settings showing how to configure Claude Code MCP integration with the generated token
- **npm-publishable notez-mcp**: Added `bin`, `files`, `engines`, `repository`, and `prepublishOnly` fields so the MCP server can be installed via `npx notez-mcp` or `npm install -g notez-mcp`
- **notez-mcp README**: Setup guide covering quick start, Claude Code configuration, all 11 tools, and token creation instructions

## [1.6.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- **Token Management API**: JWT-protected endpoints (`POST/GET/DELETE /api/tokens`) for users to create, list, and revoke API tokens
- **MCP API Routes**: New `/api/mcp/*` endpoints authenticated via API tokens — notes (search, get, get-by-title, recent, create, append), tasks (list, get, create, update status), folders (list)
- **11 MCP Tools**: `notez_search_notes`, `notez_get_note`, `notez_get_note_by_title`, `notez_list_recent`, `notez_create_note`, `notez_append_to_note`, `notez_list_tasks`, `notez_get_task`, `notez_create_task`, `notez_update_task_status`, `notez_list_folders`
- **Auth Middleware**: `authenticateApiToken` and `requireScope` middleware for API token-based route protection

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- **Service Accounts**: New `isServiceAccount` flag on users — immutable after creation, set only at account creation time. Enables admin visibility into automated agent content while guaranteeing regular user privacy.
- **Admin Service Account Browsing**: Admins can view all service account notes and tasks in a read-only "Service Accounts" virtual folder in the sidebar (notes view + task list view)
- **Admin Panel Service Account Creation**: "Service Account" checkbox when creating users, with blue badge in user list for service accounts
- **Admin API Endpoints**: `GET /api/admin/service-accounts`, `/notes`, `/notes/:id`, `/tasks` — all admin-only, paginated
- **Data Migration**: Existing `claude-agent` user automatically flagged as service account on deploy

### Changed

- **Auth Response**: `/auth/me` now includes `isServiceAccount` field
- **User Stats**: Admin stats now include `serviceAccounts` count

## [1.4.1] - 2026-02-26

### Fixed

- **Shared Note Folder/Title/Tag Changes**: Metadata changes (folder, title, tags) on shared notes were silently dropped because auto-save skipped REST API entirely in collaborative mode — now only content save is skipped (Hocuspocus handles content), metadata saves via REST as normal
- **Kanban Board Completed Tasks**: Kanban view now has a "Show completed" toggle — previously always showed all tasks regardless of filter, inconsistent with the task list view
- **Modal Text Selection**: Selecting text in ShareDialog, ConfirmDialog, and WhatsNewModal no longer accidentally closes the dialog (switched backdrop from `onClick` to `onMouseDown`)
- **Note Update Permission Errors**: Backend now returns 403 Forbidden (not 500) when non-owners attempt folder changes on shared notes

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- **Global Error Boundary**: App-level React error boundary catches unhandled component crashes and shows a recovery UI ("Reload Page" / "Go Home") instead of a white screen
- **Toast Notification System**: User-facing toast notifications for success, error, warning, and info events — replaces silent `console.error` across 10+ components
- **Backend Safe Fire-and-Forget**: `safeFireAndForget()` utility wraps notification dispatches with nested try-catch to prevent unhandled promise rejections (including `JSON.stringify` failures)

### Fixed

- **Silent Error Failures**: 15+ operations across NoteEditor, FolderSidebar, NoteList, KanbanBoard, TaskList, AdminPanel, and ShareDialog now show user-visible error toasts instead of silently failing
- **Removed All alert() Calls**: Replaced 10 remaining `alert()` calls in FolderSidebar, NoteEditor, and AdminPanel with toast notifications for consistent UX
- **useMutation Error Handlers**: NotificationBell (3 mutations) and AdminFeedbackPanel (5 mutations) now display error toasts on failure
- **Collaboration Service Crash**: Database `fetch` and `store` operations in Hocuspocus extension wrapped in try-catch to prevent WebSocket server crashes on DB errors
- **WebSocket ZodError**: Invalid noteId in WebSocket URL now closes the socket with code 1008 (Policy Violation) instead of throwing an unhandled ZodError; unexpected errors close with 1011
- **Backend Error Response Format**: AI routes now include `error` field in all error responses, standardizing the `{ error, message }` shape across all backend routes
- **Production Console Noise**: ~50 `console.error`/`console.warn` calls across 16 frontend files wrapped in `import.meta.env.DEV` guards
- **Toast UX**: Added MAX_TOASTS cap (5) with oldest eviction, custom entrance animation, mobile bottom-nav offset, and fixed ARIA double-announcement
- **Sidebar ARIA Semantics**: FolderSidebar uses `<nav aria-label="...">` with `aria-current="page"` on active items in both collapsed and expanded views; removed redundant `role="navigation"`
- **Error Boundary Nesting**: GlobalErrorBoundary moved to outermost position to catch provider crashes
- **WCAG Focus Rings**: Toast dismiss button and error boundary "Go Home" link now show visible focus rings for keyboard navigation
- **FeedbackModal Error Toast**: Submit errors now show a user-visible toast instead of being silently swallowed
- **Sidebar Triple Toast Spam**: Folder/tag/stats load failures consolidated into a single toast per batch via `Promise.allSettled`
- **AI Inline Errors → Toast**: AI feature errors (summarize, suggest title, suggest tags) now display as toasts instead of inline `<span>` elements
- **Auto-Save Error Deduplication**: Repeated auto-save failures show only one toast instead of spamming on every retry
- **Tags Toggle ARIA**: Tags section toggle button now has `aria-expanded` and `aria-controls` for screen reader users
- **AI Content Max Length**: AI endpoint schemas now enforce a 50,000-character limit to prevent oversized payloads
- **AI Error Sanitization**: AI service errors return a fixed message instead of leaking internal error details to clients
- **AdminFeedbackPanel Delete Confirm**: Native `confirm()` replaced with styled `useConfirm()` dialog for delete action
- **Error Boundary Icon**: Replaced `<span>!</span>` with Lucide `AlertCircle` icon for visual consistency

## [1.3.3] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed

- **Feedback Submit**: Added proper error handling (`onError`) and robust error message extraction to the Suggest Feature / Report Bug modal — errors from network failures, server errors, and validation are now clearly displayed with `role="alert"` for accessibility

### Changed

- **CI Pipeline**: Added `test` job that runs backend and frontend test suites before Docker build — build now gates on all 388 tests passing

## [1.3.2] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- **Backend Test Suite**: 217 new tests across 9 test files covering all critical backend code paths
  - **Tier 1 — Pure Logic**: encryption roundtrip & tamper detection, JWT token generation/verification, all 20+ Zod validation schemas (password rules, safe URL checks, FOLDER_ICONS allowlist), task extraction from HTML/Markdown, custom error classes, filename sanitization
  - **Tier 2 — Services**: auth service (login, setup, token refresh, password reset with email enumeration prevention), note service (CRUD, access control for owner/shared/view-only, soft delete/restore, pagination), auth middleware (token extraction, DoS protection, admin gating, optional auth)

## [1.3.1] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- **"Shared" Sidebar Category**: New sidebar item showing all notes you've shared with others, with count badge and dedicated list view

### Changed

- **Shared Note Icons**: Redundant share arrow badge removed from note list — the blue double-document icon (`Files`) is sufficient alone
- **Share Button Icon**: Share button in note editor and share dialog now use the universal share arrow (`Share2`) icon instead of the people (`Users`) icon

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-23

### Added

- **Auto-Select Title**: New notes auto-focus and select the "Untitled Note" title so users can immediately type a name
- **20 New Folder Icons**: Gaming (gamepad, trophy, swords, dice), finance (dollar sign, credit card), education (graduation cap, brain, flask), health (dumbbell), nature/travel (mountain, tree, plane), communication (mail, message), security (lock, shield), entertainment (headphones, TV), and tools (wrench) — 68 total icons

### Changed

- **Shared Note Icons**: Shared notes now display a distinct blue double-document icon (`Files`) in the note list, plus a share arrow (`Share2`) badge, making them instantly identifiable when scanning
- **Sidebar Order**: "Shared with me" moved from below Tags to directly after Tasks — primary views (All Notes, Tasks, Shared) now grouped together at the top of the sidebar
- **Collaborator Colors**: Replaced hash-to-HSL color generation with a curated 12-color palette for maximum visual distinction between collaborators (fixes near-identical colors for similar short usernames)
- **Icon Picker Scrolling**: Icon picker dropdown now scrolls when needed instead of overflowing the viewport

## [1.2.2] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed

- **Collaborative Editor Crash (Root Cause)**: Fixed the actual crash when opening shared notes — `@tiptap/extension-collaboration-cursor@3.0.0` depended on `y-prosemirror` (external), which conflicted with `@tiptap/y-tiptap` (TipTap's internal fork). Both defined `ySyncPluginKey('y-sync')` as different `PluginKey` instances, causing the Collaboration extension's options to be lost during extension resolution. Replaced both packages with a custom extension that imports `ySyncPlugin`, `yUndoPlugin`, and `yCursorPlugin` directly from `@tiptap/y-tiptap`.
- **Shared Editor Extensions**: All TipTap extensions now come from a single `editorExtensions.ts` module, preventing config divergence between collaborative and non-collaborative editors.
- **Link Extension Security**: Added protocol allowlist (`http`, `https`, `mailto`) and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to all link elements.
- **Dual Undo System Conflict**: StarterKit's built-in `undoRedo` is now disabled in collaborative mode to prevent conflicts with Yjs undo.

### Removed

- Removed `@tiptap/extension-collaboration` — replaced by custom extension using `@tiptap/y-tiptap` directly
- Removed `@tiptap/extension-collaboration-cursor` — cursor plugin now imported from `@tiptap/y-tiptap`
- Removed `y-prosemirror` transitive dependency (source of the PluginKey conflict)

## [1.2.1] - 2026-02-22

### Fixed

- **Collaborative Editor Crash**: Fixed white screen crash when opening shared notes (provider sync race condition)
- **Collaborative Editor Auth Handling**: Auth failures now show clear error and stop reconnection attempts
- **Collaborative Editor Sync Timeout**: Added 15-second timeout with retry button when server is unreachable
- **Collaborative Editor Reconnect Stability**: Editor no longer tears down during transient WebSocket reconnects
- **Collaborative Editor noteId Validation**: Client-side UUID validation prevents malformed WebSocket URLs
- **Collaborative Editor Accessibility**: Added ARIA live regions, reduced-motion support, spinner aria-hidden, upload button labels
- **Image Upload Feedback**: Invalid file type/size and upload failures now show user-visible error messages

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-21
